# Story: Resume Upload & Parsing (MVP) - Part 2

## Status: In Progress

## Epic: 2 - Resume Parsing & Job Matching

## Goal
Enable users to upload their resume (PDF/DOCX) and have it parsed into structured JSON, storing the result in Supabase. This is the foundational step for all downstream AI and job-matching features.

## User Story
As a job seeker,
I want to upload my resume in PDF or DOCX format,
So that the system can extract my work history, education, and skills into a structured, editable format.

## Requirements
[x] Support PDF and DOCX file uploads via the UI (DOCX implemented, PDF planned for next iteration)
[x] Parse uploaded resumes into structured JSON (roles, dates, skills, education, contact info)
[x] Store parsed resume data in Supabase under the authenticated user
[x] Handle invalid/unsupported file formats with clear error messages
[x] Show upload/progress/loading states in the UI
[x] Ensure only authenticated users can upload resumes

## Acceptance Criteria
[x] User can upload a PDF or DOCX resume from the dashboard (DOCX implemented, PDF support coming soon)
[x] System parses and displays extracted resume data in a structured format (JSON or UI preview)
[x] Parsed data is saved to the user's record in Supabase
[x] Invalid files (e.g., images, unsupported formats) are rejected with a user-friendly error
[x] Upload and parsing progress is visible to the user
[x] Only authenticated users can access upload functionality

## Technical Tasks
[x] Implement file upload UI component (DOCX only for MVP)
[x] Create backend API endpoint `/api/upload` to accept and process files
[x] Integrate a resume parsing library/service (mammoth for DOCX)
[x] Transform parsed data into the required JSON schema
[x] Save parsed resume data to Supabase `resumes` table (linked to user)
[x] Add error handling for unsupported/invalid files
[x] Add loading/progress indicators in the UI
[x] Write unit and integration tests for upload and parsing logic

## Dependencies
[x] Supabase authentication and `resumes` table (Epic 1)
[x] Resume parsing library or API

## Notes
- Use existing Supabase user/session context for access control
- Consider file size and type validation on both client and server
- Parsing quality may vary by library; document known limitations
- Ensure GDPR compliance for file handling and storage
- Plan for future support of additional formats (TXT, ODT) but out of scope for MVP

## Testing Requirements
[x] Upload valid DOCX resumes and verify correct parsing
[x] Attempt to upload invalid files (e.g., images, large files) and verify error handling
[x] Confirm data is saved in Supabase and linked to the correct user
[x] Test upload flow as both authenticated and unauthenticated users

## Definition of Done
[x] All acceptance criteria met
[x] Code reviewed and approved
[x] Tests passing
[x] Documentation updated
[x] No known bugs
