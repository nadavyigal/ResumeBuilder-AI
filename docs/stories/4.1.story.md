# Story: Validate and Ensure Complete Supabase Backend Integration

## Status: Approved

## Epic: 4 - Backend Infrastructure & Data Persistence

## Goal
Validate and ensure that all application components are fully integrated with Supabase as the backend, including authentication, database operations, real-time subscriptions, storage, and Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

## User Story
As a system administrator,
I want to ensure that all application features properly utilize Supabase backend services,
So that the application operates reliably with proper data persistence, security, and real-time capabilities.

## Requirements
- [ ] Validate all authentication flows use Supabase Auth exclusively
- [ ] Ensure all database operations go through Supabase client
- [ ] Verify RLS policies are properly enforced for all tables
- [ ] Test real-time subscriptions for collaborative features
- [ ] Validate file storage integration for resume uploads
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling for Supabase service failures
- [ ] Verify environment variables are correctly configured
- [ ] Test database connection pooling and performance
- [ ] Validate data models match Supabase schema
- [ ] Ensure proper session management and token refresh

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All auth endpoints successfully authenticate via Supabase Auth
- [ ] Database CRUD operations work correctly with proper user isolation
- [ ] RLS policies prevent unauthorized data access
- [ ] Real-time updates propagate within 500ms
- [ ] File uploads store correctly in Supabase Storage
- [ ] Application gracefully handles Supabase service interruptions
- [ ] All environment variables are documented and validated
- [ ] Database queries perform within acceptable thresholds (<100ms for simple queries)
- [ ] TypeScript types match actual database schema
- [ ] Session refresh happens automatically without user disruption

## Technical Tasks
1. [ ] Create comprehensive Supabase connection test suite
   - Test auth.getUser() across all protected routes
   - Validate session persistence and refresh
   - Test OAuth provider integrations
   - Verify JWT token handling in middleware

2. [ ] Implement database operation validation
   - Test profiles table operations (per DS.md schema)
   - Test resumes table with JSONB content field
   - Verify all TypeScript interfaces match DS.md definitions
   - Test transaction rollback scenarios
   - Validate indexes: idx_resumes_user_id, idx_resumes_is_public

3. [ ] Set up RLS policy testing framework
   - Test policies from 002_fix_rls_policies.sql
   - Verify profiles_select_own, profiles_insert_own, profiles_update_own
   - Test resumes_select_own, resumes_select_public policies
   - Verify cross-user data isolation
   - Test handle_new_user() trigger function

4. [ ] Validate data structures alignment
   - Ensure Database interface matches actual schema
   - Verify Json type handling for resume content
   - Test all API interfaces from DS.md (GenerateRequest, UploadResponse, etc.)
   - Validate ResumeContent structure with JSONB storage
   - Test ParsedResumeData transformations

5. [ ] Create storage integration tests
   - Set up Supabase Storage bucket for resume files
   - Test file upload with 10MB limit (per DS.md)
   - Verify file access permissions via RLS
   - Test PDF/DOCX file processing pipeline

6. [ ] Build connection resilience layer
   - Implement retry logic for failed requests
   - Add circuit breaker for service outages
   - Create fallback UI states
   - Handle Supabase rate limits gracefully

7. [ ] Develop environment validation script
   - Check NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
   - Validate NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   - Test SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (server-side only)
   - Verify DATABASE_URL if direct connection used
   - Test connection on startup

8. [ ] Create performance monitoring
   - Implement query performance tracking (<100ms target)
   - Monitor JSONB content field performance
   - Track API rate limits
   - Add indexes per DS.md recommendations

9. [ ] Synchronize TypeScript types
   - Update src/types/supabase.ts with updated_at fields
   - Add missing table columns from migrations
   - Validate against DS.md type definitions
   - Generate types from live Supabase schema

10. [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling
    - Handle auth.users trigger failures gracefully
    - Catch JSONB parsing errors
    - Provide user-friendly error messages
    - Create error recovery workflows
    - Log errors with structured format

## Dependencies
- [x] Basic Supabase setup (completed in previous stories)
- [x] Database migrations executed (001 and 002)
- [x] Authentication system implemented (Epic 1)
- [ ] Supabase project properly configured with:
  - [ ] Auth providers enabled
  - [ ] Storage buckets created
  - [ ] RLS policies applied
  - [ ] Edge functions deployed (if needed)

## Notes
- Use Supabase's built-in monitoring for performance insights
- Consider implementing Supabase Edge Functions for complex operations
- Ensure all client-side operations use anon key, server-side can use service key
- Document any Supabase-specific limitations discovered
- Consider implementing database backups and recovery procedures
- Review Supabase's rate limits and plan accordingly

### Known Issues to Address:
- Multiple Supabase client implementations exist (lib/supabase.ts, utils/supabase/*)
- Need to standardize on SSR-compatible client approach
- Verify updated_at fields are properly tracked (missing in current types)
- Ensure all API routes use proper authentication checks
- Storage bucket configuration needs validation
- Real-time features not yet implemented but in data flow diagram

### Integration Points to Validate:
- `/api/upload` - File processing and database storage
- `/api/generate` - AI generation with user context
- `/api/regenerate-section` - Section updates with RLS
- `/api/export-pdf` - Resume retrieval and export
- Authentication middleware - Session validation
- Profile creation trigger - New user onboarding

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for all Supabase client operations
- [ ] Integration tests for auth flows
- [ ] E2E tests for critical user journeys
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent operations
- [ ] Security testing for RLS policy enforcement
- [ ] Failover testing for service interruptions
- [ ] Performance benchmarking for database queries
