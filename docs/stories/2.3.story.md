# Story: Resume Upload & Parsing (MVP) - Part 3

## Status: Complete

## Epic: 2 - Resume Parsing & Job Matching

## Goal
Enhance the resume upload and parsing feature by adding PDF support and improving error handling, ensuring a robust and user-friendly experience for job seekers.

## User Story
As a job seeker,
I want to upload my resume in PDF format,
So that the system can extract my work history, education, and skills into a structured, editable format, just like with DOCX.

## Requirements
- [ ] Support PDF file uploads via the UI
- [ ] Parse uploaded PDF resumes into structured JSON (roles, dates, skills, education, contact info)
- [ ] Store parsed resume data in Supabase under the authenticated user
- [ ] Handle invalid/unsupported file formats with clear error messages
- [ ] Show upload/progress/loading states in the UI
- [ ] Ensure only authenticated users can upload resumes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User can upload a PDF resume from the dashboard
- [ ] System parses and displays extracted resume data in a structured format (JSON or UI preview)
- [ ] Parsed data is saved to the user's record in Supabase
- [ ] Invalid files (e.g., images, unsupported formats) are rejected with a user-friendly error
- [ ] Upload and parsing progress is visible to the user
- [ ] Only authenticated users can access upload functionality

## Technical Tasks
1. [ ] Implement PDF file upload UI component
2. [ ] Create backend API endpoint `/api/upload` to accept and process PDF files
3. [ ] Integrate a resume parsing library/service for PDF (e.g., pdf-parse)
4. [ ] Transform parsed data into the required JSON schema
5. [ ] Save parsed resume data to Supabase `resumes` table (linked to user)
6. [ ] Add error handling for unsupported/invalid files
7. [ ] Add loading/progress indicators in the UI
8. [ ] Write unit and integration tests for upload and parsing logic

## Dependencies
- [ ] Supabase authentication and `resumes` table (Epic 1)
- [ ] Resume parsing library or API for PDF

## Notes
- Use existing Supabase user/session context for access control
- Consider file size and type validation on both client and server
- Parsing quality may vary by library; document known limitations
- Ensure GDPR compliance for file handling and storage
- Plan for future support of additional formats (TXT, ODT) but out of scope for MVP

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Upload valid PDF resumes and verify correct parsing
- [ ] Attempt to upload invalid files (e.g., images, large files) and verify error handling
- [ ] Confirm data is saved in Supabase and linked to the correct user
- [ ] Test upload flow as both authenticated and unauthenticated users

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No known bugs
