# Story: Implement LLM-based Resume Rewriting

## Status: Complete âœ…

## Epic: 3 - AI Resume Generation & Editing

## Goal
Implement the core LLM-based resume rewriting functionality that analyzes a user's resume against job requirements and generates optimized content.

## User Story
As a job seeker,
I want my resume to be automatically optimized for specific job descriptions,
So that I can increase my chances of getting interviews by highlighting relevant experience and skills.

## Requirements
- [x] Create OpenAI integration for resume analysis
- [x] Implement job description parsing and keyword extraction
- [x] Develop resume content optimization logic
- [x] Build API endpoint for resume rewriting
- [x] Add error handling and fallback mechanisms
- [x] Implement rate limiting and cost controls

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] System successfully analyzes job descriptions and extracts key requirements
- [x] Resume content is rewritten to highlight relevant experience and skills
- [x] Generated content maintains factual accuracy of original resume
- [x] API responds within 5 seconds for standard resumes
- [x] System handles errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- [x] OpenAI API costs are tracked and logged
- [x] Rate limiting prevents abuse

## Technical Tasks
1. [x] Set up OpenAI API integration with proper error handling
2. [x] Create job description parser to extract requirements and keywords
3. [x] Implement resume analysis logic to identify relevant sections
4. [x] Develop content optimization prompts for different resume sections
5. [x] Build `/api/generate` endpoint with proper validation
6. [x] Add monitoring and logging for API usage and costs
7. [x] Implement rate limiting middleware
8. [x] Create fallback mechanisms for API failures

## Dependencies
- [x] Resume parsing functionality (Epic 2)
- [x] Job description parsing (Epic 2)
- [x] OpenAI API access and credentials
- [x] Supabase database for storing generated content

## Notes
- Use GPT-4 for best results, with fallback to GPT-3.5 if needed
- Implement token counting to manage costs
- Consider caching common job descriptions
- Document prompt engineering decisions
- Monitor for potential hallucinations or factual inaccuracies

## Testing Requirements
- [x] Test with various job descriptions and resume formats
- [x] Verify content accuracy against original resume
- [x] Test error handling and fallback mechanisms
- [x] Validate rate limiting functionality
- [x] Monitor API response times
- [x] Check cost tracking accuracy

## Definition of Done
- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] Code reviewed and approved
- [x] Tests passing
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] No known bugs
- [x] Cost monitoring in place
- [x] Rate limiting implemented

## Completion Notes
- Implemented on: [Current Date]
- All tests passing (16/16)
- Created comprehensive API documentation
- Manual test script provided for verification
- OpenAI integration uses GPT-3.5-turbo by default with configurable model
- Rate limiting set to 10 requests per minute per IP
- Cost tracking logs token usage and estimated costs
