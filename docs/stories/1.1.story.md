# Story: Project Infrastructure and Authentication Setup

## Status: Draft

## Epic: 1 - Infrastructure & User Onboarding

## Goal
Set up the initial project infrastructure including the NX monorepo, Supabase authentication, and basic Next.js frontend with Tailwind CSS to enable user authentication and project foundation.

## User Story
As a developer,
I want to set up the project infrastructure and authentication system,
So that we can begin building the resume builder application with a solid foundation and secure user management.

## Requirements
- [ ] Initialize NX monorepo with Next.js and Node.js serverless functions
- [ ] Set up Supabase project with authentication
- [ ] Configure Next.js frontend with Tailwind CSS
- [ ] Implement basic authentication flows (signup, login, password reset)
- [ ] Set up environment configuration and secrets management
- [ ] Create initial project documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] NX workspace successfully initialized with web and api apps
- [ ] Supabase project created and configured with authentication enabled
- [ ] Next.js frontend running with Tailwind CSS integration
- [ ] Users can sign up with email/password
- [ ] Users can log in with email/password
- [ ] Users can reset their password
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured and documented
- [ ] Basic project documentation in place

## Technical Tasks
1. [ ] Initialize NX workspace
   - [ ] Create new NX workspace
   - [ ] Add Next.js application
   - [ ] Add Node.js serverless functions
   - [ ] Configure workspace settings

2. [ ] Set up Supabase
   - [ ] Create new Supabase project
   - [ ] Configure authentication settings
   - [ ] Set up database schema
   - [ ] Configure security rules

3. [ ] Configure Next.js frontend
   - [ ] Install and configure Tailwind CSS
   - [ ] Set up basic layout components
   - [ ] Create authentication pages
   - [ ] Implement Supabase client integration

4. [ ] Implement authentication flows
   - [ ] Create signup form and logic
   - [ ] Create login form and logic
   - [ ] Implement password reset flow
   - [ ] Add authentication state management

5. [ ] Set up environment and documentation
   - [ ] Create .env.example file
   - [ ] Document environment variables
   - [ ] Create initial README.md
   - [ ] Document setup instructions

## Dependencies
- [ ] Node.js and npm installed
- [ ] Supabase account created
- [ ] Git repository initialized
- [ ] Development environment configured

## Notes
- Use Supabase Auth for authentication
- Implement proper error handling for auth flows
- Ensure secure storage of environment variables
- Follow project structure as defined in architecture docs
- Consider implementing rate limiting for auth endpoints

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Test workspace initialization
- [ ] Test Supabase connection
- [ ] Test authentication flows
- [ ] Test environment configuration
- [ ] Verify documentation completeness

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No known bugs
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] Authentication flows working as expected
