# Story: Implement Freemium Gating & Payment System

## Status: Draft

## Epic: 5 - Freemium Gating & Payments

## Goal
Implement a comprehensive freemium model with Stripe billing integration, usage limits, and feature gating to drive user conversion from free to premium tiers.

## User Story
As a business owner,
I want to implement a freemium model with payment processing and feature gating,
So that I can monetize the platform while providing value to free users and encouraging upgrades.

## Requirements
- [ ] Integrate Stripe billing system for payment processing
- [ ] Implement user tier management in Supabase
- [ ] Create Row Level Security (RLS) policies for feature gating
- [ ] Set up usage limits and tracking for free tier
- [ ] Implement premium template gating
- [ ] Add export limit enforcement for free users
- [ ] Create upsell prompts and conversion flows
- [ ] Implement subscription management interface
- [ ] Add billing history and invoice access
- [ ] Create account tier upgrade/downgrade flows

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Free users can create up to 3 resumes per month
- [ ] Free users can export up to 2 PDFs per month
- [ ] Premium templates are gated behind paywall
- [ ] Stripe checkout flow works seamlessly
- [ ] Subscription changes are reflected immediately in UI
- [ ] Usage limits are enforced at API level
- [ ] RLS policies prevent unauthorized access to premium features
- [ ] Users can view their current usage and limits
- [ ] Billing portal allows subscription management
- [ ] Failed payments are handled gracefully with retry logic
- [ ] Account cancellation preserves user data for 30 days

## Technical Tasks
1. [ ] Set up Stripe integration with webhook handling
2. [ ] Create user subscription table in Supabase
3. [ ] Implement RLS policies for tier-based access control
4. [ ] Create usage tracking system for resumes and exports
5. [ ] Build subscription management API endpoints
6. [ ] Implement Stripe checkout and billing portal integration
7. [ ] Create usage limit middleware for API routes
8. [ ] Build account settings page with billing information
9. [ ] Implement upsell prompts in key user flows
10. [ ] Add subscription status indicators throughout UI
11. [ ] Create webhook handlers for subscription events
12. [ ] Implement graceful degradation for payment failures
