# Story: User Profile and Resume CRUD Management

## Status: Done

## Epic: 1 - Infrastructure & User Onboarding

## Goal
Enable authenticated users to manage their profile information and create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) resumes within the application.

## User Story
As an authenticated user,
I want to manage my profile and resumes,
So that I can keep my information up to date and build multiple resumes.

## Requirements
- [x] Implement user profile page (view & edit)
- [x] Create database schema for user profiles and resumes (if not already done)
- [x] Implement CRUD operations for resumes (create, read, update, delete)
- [x] Secure all endpoints and UI to authenticated users only

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Authenticated users can view and update their profile information
- [x] Users can create new resumes, view a list of their resumes, edit, and delete them
- [x] All resume data is securely stored in Supabase and scoped to the authenticated user
